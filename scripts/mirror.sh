# Push the docs folder's history to its standalone repository, which deploys
# GitHub Pages on push to main:
#   docs -> avleonjs/avleonjs.github.io
#
# The npm packages are no longer mirrored: they are versioned and published
# from this repository with Lerna (see README.md).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/mirror.sh          mirror docs
#   scripts/mirror.sh docs     same
#
# Pushes are fast-forward only: if the standalone repo has commits the
# monorepo does not, the push is rejected instead of overwriting them.
